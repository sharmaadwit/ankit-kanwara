Topic: Customer Support Live Chat Implementation

Problem Statement: The lack of a customer support live chat results in slow response times, inefficient query handling, and missed opportunities for real-time engagement. This negatively impacts customer satisfaction and potentially increases support costs. Implementing a live chat with seamless agent transfer is crucial for providing immediate, efficient support and improving the overall customer experience.

Next Steps:

Action Item: Share a video demonstration showcasing the ""Agent Assist"" feature interacting with a customer within the proposed live chat environment.

This necessitates human agents handling numerous simpler queries, many of which have readily available solutions on the Star Health portal. This inefficient routing contributes to increased call volumes for human agents, longer average handling times (currently 5 minutes), potentially longer wait times for customers, and an underutilization of Star Health's self-service resources. To significantly enhance operational efficiency and improve customer experience, Star Health needs to implement an AI agent over their Ozontel IVR system. This solution must be prioritized for voice interactions and be capable of resolving the maximum possible number of customer queries (P3 and P4). It should also seamlessly guide customers to self-service options on the portal, accurately address P3 and P4 inquiries with a target Average Handling Time (AHT) of 2.5 minutes, and offer seamless handover to human agents or a convenient call-back option for complex issues. Furthermore, Star Health seeks to integrate a WhatsApp solution to provide an additional support channel. Integration with their existing Zoho CRM is also a key requirement.

Use Case Narrative:

A Star Health customer initiates contact via the Ozontel IVR system. An AI agent greets the customer and intelligently analyzes their query. If the query is identified as a P3 or P4 issue, and the solution is available on the Star Health portal or within the AI agent's knowledge base, the AI agent will provide the necessary information or guide the customer towards the DIY solution, aiming for an AHT of 2.5 minutes. For more complex issues or if the AI agent cannot resolve the query, it will seamlessly transfer the call to a qualified human agent. Alternatively, if no agent is immediately available or if preferred by the customer, the AI agent will offer a convenient call-back option. Approx volume - 4lakh calls per month 

In parallel, Star Health aims to implement a WhatsApp support channel integrated with Zoho CRM. Customers can initiate conversations via WhatsApp, and an AI agent (or potentially a human agent) can address their queries. Similar to the voice channel, the goal is to resolve P3 and P4 queries efficiently and escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary. All interactions across both voice and WhatsApp channels will be logged and managed within Zoho CRM to provide a holistic view of the customer journey. The voice channel via the Ozontel integration is the priority for the initial implementation.

Next steps : A demo call to showcase the voice and whatsapp capabilities

The primary use case discussed involves a coupon redemption flow facilitated by the WhatsApp chatbot:

Consumers will encounter Essilor advertisements on digital platforms (e.g., Meta).

A call-to-action (CTA) button within these ads will redirect consumers to the Essilor WhatsApp Bot.

The bot will then provide consumers with unique, one-time-use coupon codes.

The bot will also feature a store locator, enabling consumers to find the nearest Essilor partner stores based on their pin code.

Consumers will visit these stores and present the coupon code during their purchase.

Eye Care Professionals (ECPs) at the stores will validate the coupon code (either through the solution or by contacting customer service).

Upon successful validation, the ECP will apply the relevant discount to the purchase.

The ECP will then place an order with Essilor, referencing the coupon code.

Essilor's customer service (CS) team will have access to a real-time dashboard displaying the status of all coupon codes (available, consumed, or expired). The dashboard will be updated as codes are generated and used.

The CS team will verify the coupon code provided by the ECP and record the Rx tracking number associated with the purchase.

If the coupon code is valid, CS will ensure the discount is applied to the order.

Once the order is processed, the coupon's status will be updated to ""Consumed,"" and an SMS/Whatsapp confirmation will be sent to the consumer.

If the coupon code is invalid or a duplicate, the discount claim will be rejected.

The meeting also acknowledged several exception scenarios, including:

ECPs failing to validate codes.

ECPs not passing the discount on to consumers.

Consumer complaints regarding code validity.

Consumers sharing codes.

Opticians misusing codes or encountering order conflicts.

We presented a WhatsApp environment, showcasing its capabilities in campaign creation, management, two-way communication, potential AI integration, and HubSpot integration limited to one-way message data. The client raised the requirement for integrating dashboard data, such as targeted audience and message delivery status, into HubSpot, noting that this would necessitate custom development. We outlined two pricing structures: a self-serve option and a built-by-us option, each with distinct costs and implementation timelines. The client requested quotations for both models, specifying webinar reminders and marketing messages as the key use cases.

Agreed Next Steps:

We will provide commercial proposals detailing the costs and implementation timelines for both the self-serve and custom development approaches.

We will clarify the estimated timelines for custom development, taking into account the defined use cases of webinar reminders and marketing messages, the scope of work involved, required API integrations, and the complexity and number of journeys to be built.

The client will proceed to discuss the received commercial proposals and the potential implementation plan and timeline with their finance and technical teams for internal review and decision-making.

WhatsApp is currently inbound-only through ChatWood (two numbers: 0800 and DDD11), with minimal volume. Past active tests on unofficial WA numbers brought a surge of responses but led to quick number bans.

1. Welcome and Onboarding Message Flow:

 

When a new joiner joins the SULB vertical, the WhatsApp system automatically sends a personalized welcome message.
 

The system should be capable of identifying if the employee belongs to the Sales/Credit/Collection/Lead Management/RCU/Legal/Technical/HR etc team.
 

Based on the team, it should send the list of mandatory learning modules, Regional Training Manager, state HR contact details, and Reporting Managers details.
 

 

2. Learning Notifications and Alerts:

 

The WhatsApp number should act as a central notification bot for all modular learning or course launches by the L&D team.

 

It Should be able to push notifications to the entire SULB workforce whenever:

 

A new module is assigned
 

There are updates in course deadlines
 

Reminders for pending courses are required
3. Reminder Automation:

 

From the start date of a course to the end date, the WhatsApp bot should automatically send regular reminder messages to the respective employees.
 

The reminder message will include a gentle nudge to complete the course before the deadline with a direct course access link (if applicable).",,,,,

While they have implemented e-verification and digital signing, critical steps like customer verification, income assessment, and credit evaluation still involve significant manual intervention through field officers and credit teams. They also have a scoring model and limited Account Aggregator integrations but lack bot-driven verifications and real-time automation. There’s strong potential to streamline sourcing, enhance risk checks, and reduce processing time through digital workflows, AA-based income analysis, and intelligent communication tools like automated reminders and customer verification via call centers or WhatsApp.",,,,,

Customers typically buy products on partner sites and repay through the Snapmint app, which also serves as a key channel for repeat users and cross-selling personal loans. Existing solutions like Limechat for WhatsApp-based support and new order handling are in place, but there is scope to strengthen this with voice integrations, agent handovers, and deeper automation.

WhatsApp is also being used for abandoned cart recovery, offering incentives like coupons, free shipping, or in-store pickup.

New tests are beginning with WhatsApp for follow-ups based on browsing behavior, where intent to purchase has been detected.

external,30-06-2025,gourav.sarkar@gupshup.io,Customer Calls,Onecard,"Marketing, Commerce",Mohyeldein Elbaroudy,Retail & eCommerce,NA,AI Agents | Journey Builder,WhatsApp,Scoping / SOW,"Project Goal Ahmed Fahmy stated that their goal is to create a new sales channel through WhatsApp, allowing users to register, view product categories, select items, pay via a link, and receive codes via email, SMS, or WhatsApp. Gourav Sarkar confirmed this flow, where users would complete the entire purchase process within WhatsApp (00:03:34).
Past Experience and Key Requirement Ahmed Fahmy mentioned a previous unsuccessful attempt to implement a similar system due to WhatsApp's restrictions on registering their services. Therefore, a crucial requirement for this new project is to ensure that WhatsApp will approve the use case for digital products (00:04:54).
Expected User Volume and Scope Gourav Sarkar inquired about the expected user volumes on WhatsApp. Ahmed Fahmy estimated a potential of 500,000 to 1 million users within a year of going online (00:05:48). The target audience includes both existing registered customers and new customers, aiming to add WhatsApp as an additional sales channel (00:07:59).
System Integration Gourav Sarkar asked about existing systems for integration. Ahmed Fahmy confirmed they use their own CRM with available APIs (00:07:59) and utilize Hyperpay as their payment gateway (00:10:27). Gourav Sarkar considered the need for APIs for registration, CRM, and the payment gateway. Ahmed Fahmy indicated that the registration might be on the same API, but they would need to verify (00:14:44).
Customer Journey in WhatsApp Ahmed Fahmy outlined the intended user journey: registration, browsing categories (including subcategories), selecting an amount, and payment via a redirected link, with confirmation returning to WhatsApp (00:09:28). While a shopping cart within WhatsApp was considered, Ahmed Fahmy stated it is not currently a priority as most payments are for a single item (00:13:54).
FAQ and AI Capabilities Gourav Sarkar inquired about the need for FAQs or customer support within the chatbot (00:16:01). Ahmed Fahmy suggested a more intelligent bot capable of identifying products based on typed keywords and directing users accordingly, indicating a desire for a small AI feature (00:16:48). Mohyeldein Elbaroudy clarified that FAQ automation would be part of the use cases, potentially leveraging information available on their website (00:17:45).
Target Users and Languages Ahmed Fahmy specified that the WhatsApp bot is intended for external customers only. The initial languages supported will be Arabic and English, with a plan to start with English (00:17:45).
Campaigns and Data Retention Gourav Sarkar asked about plans for WhatsApp campaigns, which Ahmed Fahmy confirmed they would use (00:19:10). Regarding data retention, Ahmed Fahmy stated that most data is logged on their system and that logging for only one or two days would be sufficient (00:20:18).
Market Focus and Verification Ahmed Fahmy mentioned having two markets, Saudi and global, each with different pricing, but the initial focus will be on the Saudi market. The current SMS verification for registration will be replaced with WhatsApp verification (00:21:14).
Next Steps Gourav Sarkar stated that Ahmed Fahmy had answered all their queries and that GI would reach out to them with a technical proposal. Both parties expressed satisfaction with the discussion (00:21:14).",,,,,

Campaign context: World Class on Tour will run on Smirnoff's WhatsApp number.

Users need to register their World Class Passport with three fields: passport number, name, and email.

Photo of the passport with stamps will be required and routed to a human agent for manual approval.

The bot will not have access to external registration systems — only manages its own.

Metrics expectations: funnel-based tracking (menus accessed, registered users, confirmed Craft Class participants).

Notable Decisions:

A dedicated human agent segmenting confirmed users in Agent Assist.

Segment will be used to trigger reminder messages 2 days before the session.

All flows must allow for organic user entry to trigger the main menu anytime.

There are 3 participating venues, each hosting Craft Class for 2 days, with 1 session per day and 10 seats max per session.

Bot must validate passport number against the WhatsApp number used in the initial registration.

Once a class is full, bot suggests next available options.

If all options are full, user receives fallback: “No momento, todas as vagas para a Craft Class estão esgotadas...”

A bar database (to be provided by Diageo) must include:

Name

Latitude/Longitude

Address / Google Maps link

Operating hours

Instagram profile

Notable Decisions:

Agent interface must allow for quick validation + tagging.

User photos will not be automatically processed — no image recognition involved.

Reminder campaigns will be handled via Campaign Manager, segmented by bot-assigned tags.",,,,,

The bot must quickly identify a ""best match"" using filters: price range, brand/model, type (SUV, hatchback, etc.), minimum year, and city/state.

The user journey should be short (max 5 questions) and deliver real vehicle suggestions, preferably with a link or image.

WhatsApp will be the primary channel, triggered through paid media (Meta Ads), QR codes at events, or embedded on the website.

Important Decisions:

The MVP will use a simulated (mocked) vehicle database provided by iCarros (~50 vehicles with varied attributes).

Bot responses will not rely on real-time API queries for this version—matching logic will be static and local.

No user login or validation required in the MVP phase.",,,,,

The primary goal is to send a push message via WhatsApp to a list of hairdressers and salon owners.

The tone and content of the message will vary slightly by region, but the CTA will typically invite the user to learn more, sign up for something, or ask questions.

If the user replies to the campaign, an AI FAQ bot will take over and handle responses about:

L’Oréal Professional product lines (e.g. Absolut Repair, Metal Detox)

How to join the “Salon Emotion” or “Access” programs

Training opportunities or events

Contact and distribution channels",,,,,
external,30-06-2025,mariana.ribeiro@gupshup.io,Customer Calls,VW - Post Sale,Support,Fernando Bueno,Automotive,NA,Agent Assist | Journey Builder,WhatsApp,Discovery,"Key Points Discussed:

The support team receives high volumes of inquiries about replacement parts, accessories, and compatibility.

There’s no current API or digital catalog that consolidates vehicle part data, which prevents automation.

The interim idea is to scope a WhatsApp support flow where:

The AI collects vehicle model, year, fuel type, version, and issue description.

If no catalog match is possible, the user is routed to an after-sales specialist with all the context.

Once a digital catalog is available, AI will be trained to reference it directly and respond autonomously.

Volkswagen is considering partnering with an internal team or third-party to digitize and expose the catalog via API.",,,,,

Goal: They want to build their own integration and maintain 100% autonomy over the solution.
Systems involved for integration:
Internal proprietary system (database)
Hubspot
Salesforce (possibly part of another project)
Main requirements:
Process and recognize incoming webhook data (around 15 data points per user), including:
Name
Address
Last purchase order
Product ID
Campaign/Action ID
AI must recognize user intent (e.g., product inquiry, knowledge-related questions, purchase intent).
Example: User reaches the bot with Product ID X, but the product is no longer available → AI must suggest a similar product. If the user shows interest in the new product, the system must update System X with this new preference.
Product catalog:
Approximately 9 active products, updated weekly.",,,,,

Users who stopped transacting.
Offers are based on the reason for inactivity (e.g. competition, technical issues).
Offer logic:
Offers must be tailored to the identified problem.
There are predefined offers sent via link.
If none of the offers apply, a human agent will handle the case.
General offers are updated monthly based on need.

The company needs to solve the problem of fragmented and manual lead management and customer communication processes.

QR codes + bio links → direct users to chatbot journey (WhatsApp or RCS).

Journey: product purchase → upload bill → chance to win F1 tickets.

Engagement boosters: profile picture changes, hashtags, daily prizes.

Video Production & Personalization

One-gender shoot possible (tech can adapt), but 2-gender shoot reduces tech load.

Regional complexities (Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa → skin tone, hair texture).

Body replacement possible but costly & latency-heavy.

SOPs suggested (skin coverage, neat hair, closer shots vs full-body shots).

Tech & Hosting Considerations

Hosting app in India vs local installs (depends on client’s data privacy compliance).

Cost impact noted if external hosting needed.

User Journey Enhancements

Add CTAs: buy product, upload bill, change profile picture.

E-commerce links for tracking purchases.

Carousel format in WhatsApp suggested for richer option presentation.

Proposal & Deliverables

Proposal submission in progress → Abbas to share draft by evening; Shynil to refine and submit.

WhatsApp Widget on Course Pages
You’d like to place a WhatsApp widget on each course page so that when a customer clicks it:

They are redirected to WhatsApp chat.

The bot knows which course page they came from.

Approach:

You can use a single script/widget across all pages.

The script can automatically read the page name (or metadata) and pass it via the WhatsApp URL to Gupshup.

This page name will then act as a trigger keyword in WhatsApp, allowing us to personalize the interaction for that specific course.

Dependency: Implementation of this requires support from your tech team to add the script to your website pages and ensure the page metadata can be passed dynamically.

Optimizing Current Journey
I reviewed your current WhatsApp journey and identified opportunities for improvement. One way to enhance the user experience is by implementing a WhatsApp flow for a frictionless lead engagement process. Attaching a small mockup here for your review",,,,,
external,30-09-2025,gargi.upadhyay@gupshup.io,Customer Calls,Abbas M,Support,Dubizzle,Real Estate,Na,Advertise,WhatsApp,Demo,"CTWA Ad Setup:

Ads linked to WhatsApp → minimal bot flow (few questions).

Users must link ad accounts to configure and view active campaigns.

Only campaigns with ""CTA to WhatsApp"" button can be used.

Bot Journey & Retargeting:

Connect existing journeys in Bot Studio to ads.

Define goal nodes/milestones to track lead progress.

3-day free retargeting window → applies only to unqualified leads.

Retargeting options: fixed timing or relative timing, restricted against same-day messaging.

Retargeting Necessity & Customization:

Not mandatory but advisable to improve engagement and cost efficiency.

Pre-written messages from CTWA clicks can be customized.

Multiple journeys can be defined using icebreakers.

Data Capture & Implementation:

Initial approach: simple goals module → track leads, download data, avoid API complexity.

Google Sheets discouraged due to scalability & data loss risk.

API integration can be considered later once effectiveness confirmed.",,,,,

Key debate was AI vs API: AI to understand open-text intent and qualify users; APIs required for real-time, dynamic listing data to avoid outdated inventory.
Highlighted high-impact broker use cases: listing refresh, date blocking for rentals, lead follow-ups, and number masking for WhatsApp/voice lead tracking.

Key takeaways:

The RFP is mandatory due to Honda’s internal procurement policy (6th renewal), not due to a major dissatisfaction with the current solution.

Cost optimization was explicitly mentioned as a pain point.

The current solution runs on the BLIP platform, with support and maintenance provided by a third-party partner. This support is perceived as mostly reactive, with limited proactive optimization or continuous improvement.

The current bot journey is simple and standardized. Regardless of the entry point or selected subject (sales, financing, insurance, services, etc.), all users follow the same flow:

User identification (name and CPF)

Product type selection (automobiles or motorcycles)

Model selection

Dealership definition (by name or proximity)

Lead handover to the Dealership in Salesforce

Subject selection (e.g., consórcio, test-drive, insurance) is used only as contextual tagging and does not alter the journey structure.

Dealership routing is handled via a Honda proprietary API.

Salesforce (myHonda) is the central CRM used for lead creation, routing, and active message (utility template) triggering.

Reporting requirements include message volume, sessions (customer and dealer initiated), MAU, and reconciliation of these metrics against Salesforce data.

Agreed approach:

Propose an AS-IS migration to ensure continuity and low operational risk.

Improvements and optimizations will be proposed separately as an optional roadmap and package of service hours, outside the core AS-IS SOW.",,,,,

The main challenge highlighted is a significant drop-off across the funnel (lead → qualification → scheduling → attendance), and the expectation is that a more human-like AI interaction can improve results.

Scope discussed includes:

GenAI-based lead qualification and conversational FAQ (replacing rule-based flows).

Location-based routing (e.g., CEP) to identify the nearest unit.

Controlled knowledge base with guardrails and handoff to human agents when required.

Additional topics were mentioned but are out of scope for the current AI SOW, including unit-level routing via keywords and WhatsApp coexistence.

Next steps:

OralSin to share SDR playbook and relevant materials.

Gupshup to review the current flow and prepare a dedicated GenAI SOW.",,,,,

Introduced the Conversational Cloud Platform enabling multi-brand and multi-project management under a single login with role-based access across modules (campaigns, agent assist, analytics, etc.).

Explained Automated Campaigns as a “set and forget” feature that triggers messages based on customer behavior and events such as abandoned carts, price drops, message read/failure status, and purchase validation.

Highlighted third-party integrations (e.g., WooCommerce) within campaigns, including decision nodes to verify conditions before sending messages.

Confirmed availability of retail-focused automated campaign use-case documentation.

Emphasized the Personaliz module for dynamic customer profiling, segmentation, and cohort creation using data from bots, campaigns, agents, and e-commerce systems.

Clarified that historical e-commerce data can be bulk uploaded (one-time) into Personaliz to improve segmentation and campaign effectiveness.

Introduced Analyzer and Optimizer modules:

Analyzer: consolidated insights on campaign performance, templates, active hours, and error codes.

Optimizer: leverages the 24-hour customer-initiated window for free, personalized, and bulk messaging.

Explained Click to WhatsApp Ads, covering first-party data capture, free retargeting windows on Meta, ROI-driven funnel analytics, and integration with Conversion APIs (CAPI) across Meta and TikTok.

Discussed AI Agent capabilities, including FAQ bots and advanced product recommendation assistants using API-based tools to access external systems (e.g., order history for contextual recommendations).

Outlined AI agent setup components: knowledge sources, personality, skills, guardrails, escalation points, and automated content refresh via website scraping.

Demonstrated product recommendation bot examples, noting that response quality depends on dataset richness and training scope.

Proposed a quick Proof of Concept (PoC) using a limited product set to showcase AI bot capabilities.

Clarified that Freshdesk agent handoff integration is feasible but complex, requiring custom development due to the bot acting as middleware and the need for collaboration and dev credentials.",,,,,
