# PAMS v1.0 Launch Preparation

## Readiness Snapshot

- ✅ Automated tests: `npm test` (2026-01-02 08:42 IST) – pass
- ✅ Data integrity scripts: on-demand backfills (`normalizeSalesRepRegions`, `backfillAccountSalesRepRegions`, `backfillActivitySalesRepRegions`) run at boot
- ℹ️ Manual smoke tests recommended: login, log external/internal activity, sales-rep region filtering, reports tab switching, admin feature toggles, CSV import dry run

## Feature Inventory (v1.0)

### Core User Features
- **Dashboard** – monthly highlight cards, quick navigation actions
- **Activity Logging** – internal/external flows with account + project creation, region-aware sales-rep selection
- **Activities View** – global search, filters (channel, industry, timeframe, owner)
- **Accounts View** – account search, project details, merge utilities
- **Reports View** – monthly report selector, management tab filters, CSV export (feature-gated)
- **Win/Loss Tracking** – project win/loss dashboard *(feature-flagged)* 
- **Import Activities** – CSV upload pathway *(feature-flagged)*
- **Project Health** – risk flags for aging projects
- **SFDC Compliance** – missing-link tracker with action shortcuts

### Admin Modules (button-launched)
- **System Users** – CRUD, role/force-reset controls
- **Sales Users** – region filter/search, add/edit with currency + FX
- **Interface Settings** – layout + theme selectors
- **Analytics Targets** – presales activity goal management
- **Project Health Filters** – threshold configuration
- **Feature Flags** – enable/disable toggles for non-admins, synced with dashboard visibility
- **Login Activity Summary** – recent logins + top users, link to detailed view
- **Activity Audit Log** – export + refresh for audit events
- **Monthly Analytics Export** – admin CSV download
- **Reports Quick Launch** – opens analytics workspace
- **POC Sandbox Manager** – link-out to legacy sandbox tooling

### Hidden / Admin-Only Navigation
- `[Hidden/Admin]` **Admin & Settings** (revealed post-auth role check)
- `[Hidden/Admin]` **Login Activity (detailed view)** – `adminLoginLogs`
- `[Hidden/Admin]` **POC Sandbox** – `adminPoc`

## Deferred / Missing in v1.0

- Saved filter presets across Activities/Reports
- Per-user or role-based interface/theme overrides
- Region-aware analytics (reports summarised by sales region)
- Native SFDC integration (current workflow relies on manual link updates)
- Real external authentication / SSO (localStorage session only)
- Background job queue for reminders/escalations
- Granular performance telemetry or front-end profiling instrumentation

## Project PAMS V2 Roadmap (Draft)

### 1. Data & Persistence Hardening
- Graduate from browser `localStorage` to managed backend storage (PostgreSQL) with migration utilities
- Introduce API auth tokens + refresh logic to secure endpoints
- Implement real audit retention with filtering/export at scale

### 2. Workflow Enhancements
- Saved filter sets & smart defaults per user
- Guided activity templates by vertical / solution type
- Automated follow-up reminders and escalation paths based on Project Health

### 3. Analytics Evolution
- Region & currency-aware dashboards with trend lines
- Scheduled reports (email / Slack digest) leveraging existing analytics output
- Comparative win/loss analytics across time periods

### 4. Integrations & Automation
- Bi-directional SFDC sync (accounts, opportunities, activity push)
- CSV import validation service with error queue + retry
- Optional MS Teams / Slack webhook for key events (wins, high-risk projects)

### 5. Experience & Accessibility
- Responsive refinements for tablet/mobile field usage
- Accessibility sweep (ARIA roles, keyboard nav, color contrast)
- Inline help overlays / onboarding tour for new admins

### 6. Operational Readiness
- CI pipeline with automated tests + lint
- Blue/green deployment or staging branch policy (`project-pams-v2`)
- Observability: request tracing, structured metrics, and log shipping policy

> This roadmap assumes v1.0 remains stable on `main`, while ongoing development continues on `project-pams-v2`. Update this document as priorities shift.
