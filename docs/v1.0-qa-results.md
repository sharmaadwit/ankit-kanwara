# PAMS v1.0 QA Run-through

Date: 2026-01-02  
Conducted by: GPT-5 Codex (Cursor)  
Target Commit: `215fbd4` (main)  
Release Tag: _pending (`v1.0.0`)_  

## Environment

- Backend/API: Node 18 (per `package.json` engines)
- Automated suite: `npm test` (Jest) – Passed at 2026-01-02 08:42 IST  
- Data storage: Browser `localStorage` (requires manual UI validation)
- Notes: Browser-driven flows cannot be executed headlessly in this environment; manual steps are documented for on-machine verification.

## Summary

| Area | Scenario | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | Login with existing admin, verify logout button | **Pending Manual** | Ensure default admin credentials (per `DataManager.initialize`) work and session clears on logout. |
| Dashboard | Stats render, nav cards launch correct views | **Pending Manual** | After login confirm stats update, click-through to Activities/Reports/Admin works. |
| Activities | Log external activity with new account + project | **Pending Manual** | Validate sales rep region filtering, account/project creation, activity saved & visible. |
| Activities | Log internal activity | **Pending Manual** | Confirm required fields, saved entry appears in Recent Activities. |
| Accounts | Search, view details, merge account flow | **Pending Manual** | Requires seeded data; ensure no empty state regressions. |
| Reports | Switch tabs, export CSV (if enabled) | **Pending Manual** | Confirm management filters populate regions/users; CSV export obeys feature flag. |
| Win/Loss | Access view when enabled, filters work | **Pending Manual** | Toggle via Admin feature flags if hidden. |
| Project Health | Risk cards render with thresholds | **Pending Manual** | Validate admin threshold changes reflect after refresh. |
| SFDC Compliance | List renders, open action buttons | **Pending Manual** | Confirm “log update” workflow unaffected by prompt removal. |
| Admin: Users | Create/edit/deactivate user | **Pending Manual** | Ensure role checkboxes persist, force password toggle stored. |
| Admin: Sales Users | Add rep, region filter/search | **Pending Manual** | Validate new rep defaults to selected region and appears in Activities modal. |
| Admin: Feature Flags | Enable/disable modules for non-admin | **Pending Manual** | Flip win/loss or CSV import; verify sidebar hides for non-admin in fresh session. |
| Admin: Analytics Target | Update numeric target | **Pending Manual** | Confirm summary text updates. |
| Admin: Logs | Login metrics refresh, audit export | **Pending Manual** | Trigger activity, refresh tables, export CSV to verify download. |
| CSV Import | Dry run + commit | **Pending Manual** | Validate success/failure notifications and data creation. |
| API Health | `/api/storage` smoke (via Jest suite) | **Pass** | Covered in automated tests. |

## Blocking Issues

None discovered in automated checks. Manual UI verification is required before final release sign-off.

## Recommended Manual Steps

1. `npm install` (if fresh environment) → `npm start`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome/Edge
3. Login with seeded admin (`admin@gupshup.io` / `admin123` unless changed)
4. Execute scenarios in table above, capturing screenshots for records
5. Repeat quick regression as non-admin user to confirm feature flag visibility

## Sign-off

- Automated coverage: ✅
- Manual coverage: ☐ _Pending product owner confirmation_

Please update the Status column once each scenario is exercised.
